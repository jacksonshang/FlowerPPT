# FlowerPPT
A VBA Plug-in Tool to help you to make beautiful PresentationÔºÅ

Current Version: Beta 1

I am a very heavy user of microsoft PPT, and every year I make hundreds of PPT documents with thousands of pages in it. This project comes first from my idea of making my PPT more beautiful and my work easier. I put arround 40 arrangement functions, together with 16 office menu functions, in one menu so that user can reach them directly. All arrangement functions are programed with VBA, and currently it is still a beta version. I hope this little tool can do some help to people like me.

Tell me if you have any question or idea about it!

thanks
